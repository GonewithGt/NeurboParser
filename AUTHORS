Authors of NeurboParser.
=======================
NeurboParser is designed by Hao Peng, Sam Thomson, and Noah A. Smith, 
and is implemented based on TurboParser by André Martins.
The decoder of NeurboParser is based on the AD3 library, written by André Martins.
It uses the Eigen template library for linear algebra,
a project started by Benoît Jacob and Gaël Guennebaud; and the Google libraries 
glog and gflags, for logging and commandline flags processing.
